# QA-Practice

This is a summary of QA practices. It is currently still in development.

For testing I have used OS __Windows 10 x64__ and Web-browser __Google Chrome 110.0.5481.178__.

## Directory "Nova-Poshta"

This is an individual project that I tested to improve my skills of writing test documentation:

* test cases
* bug reports

And execution of test-run with output results in PDF file. 

Link to the main page of Internet resource which was tested: https://novaposhta.ua/. The form of authorization and navigation panel were tested. Functional and usability testing conducted, security testing was also conducted partially. The main directory "Nova-Poshta" consist of several subdirectory such as:
* "Test-cases"
* "Bug-reports"
* "Test-runs"

### Subdirectory "Test-cases"

 I used TMS TestRail to write test cases. Subdirectory "Test-cases" consist of 2 test suits: __authorization__ test suit and __navigation__ test suit. In the corresponding folders you can see screens of written test cases.
 
 ### Subdirectory "Test-runs"
 
 I used TMS TestRail to execute test runs. There are 2 PDF files with result of execution in this subdirectory.
 
 ### Subdirectory "Bug-reports"
  
 I used bug tracking system Jira to writing bug reports. Subdirectory "Test-cases" consist of screenshots of writting bug reports and attachments to these bug reports (screenshots of defects).
  
 ## Directory "Bug reports and Postman"
  
 This is a test task that I did to find employment in IT company. The task was as follows:
  
 1. On the website http://opencart.qatestlab.net/
 Find and describe at least 8 bug reports with MS Excel.

2. On the page https://petstore.swagger.io/#/ test the work of the following API with Postman:
- Create user
- Update user
- Get user by username
- Delete user

As a result, I have written 20 bug reports that you can find in Bug reports.xlsx file. And I also retrived a JSON file with data by using Postman that you can fing in Users.postman_collection.json file.
